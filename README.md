# unity-babylon-shader-comparison
This project was created to demonstrate how Unity Shadergraph perfectly handles applying a 360 2:1 equirectangular panorama to the view direction as a skybox effect, regardless of the mesh shape, versus BablyonJS's Node Material Editor which for some reason has terrible looking jagged seam artifacts at the moment. The math is the exact same between the two.
